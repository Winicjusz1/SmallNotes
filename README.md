# SmallNotes
 The Small Notes application is similar to the BigToDo List application because it also dynamically creates divs with the content that is captured this time from the textarea field. Contrary to ToDoList, the id category and text content contained in options are captured here - this time not with - if else - but with "onchange" and passing the captured values to the "selectValue" function. In connection with the creation of notes, the so-called "live collection" and therefore I had to use document.getElementsByClassName instead of document.querySelectorAll. It also shows how to use the Switch conditional operator when changing note colors.
